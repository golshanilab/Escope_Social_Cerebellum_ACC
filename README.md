https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t4b8gtj80

Data acquired by Dr. Sung Won Hur using E-Scope developed in the Golshani lab.

Dataset containing electrophysiology, calcium imaging and behavioral measurements taken from freely behaving mice recorded in an 48 x 48 cm open field arena during social interaction.

Electrophysiological data contain recordings from Crus I Purkinje cells (PCs) and dentate nucleus (DN) neurons.
Miniscope calcium imaging data are recordings from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons.

All processed datasets are saved as a *.mat file.
